    <article>
        <p>Hi! My name is Chyniece and I'm a student at Code Crew where I am currently learning all the things about
            software development. My hope is to become a well rounded fullstack engineer. I am passionate about
            <strong>The Arts</strong> and I aim to incorpate that with coding. </p>
        <p id="hood"> Honestly, I did not expect to be where I am now considering my background mainly consists of The
            Arts. Being born in Memphis, the city of the blues, it was natural that I leaned toward The Arts. I've
            danced for most of my life but once I knew I no longer was passionate about pursuing a career in it, I
            pursued other avenues. I took to fashion and business and when I couldn't find my feet there, I gravitated
            to the tech industry where I began learning more about marketing and advertising specifically focusing on
            data analytics. That quickly turned into me wanting to know more about coding as I was introduced to Excel,
            SQL and then Python.</p>
        <p id="hobby">My hobbies include hot yoga, taking dance classes, and anything beauty related.</p>
        <p id="active">I'm not a fan of sports but I consider dance a sport becuause its a very physical activity.</p>
